* The details about parameter choosing, optimizer etc are inside report pdf file.
* The Optimizer we choosed to use is adadelta which is adam with initial momuntum.
* The hyper paremeters we used are: 4758026
* The final accuracy for training is: 99.99%
* The final accuracy for test is: 91.03%
* The total Epoch is: 100
